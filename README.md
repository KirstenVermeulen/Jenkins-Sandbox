# Jenkins-Sandbox

This repository serves as a sandbox repo to test certain Jenkins pipelines / jobs

(1) This is my first commit to see wheter or not the GitHub webhook is working.

(2) This time, I implemented the actual webhook. Now the job should trigger!

(3) I added a Jenkins file to execute a pipeline instead of a job as well as an Angular application that is build and deployed using this Jenkins file and Docker.

(4) Retry!
